# SQLite rules

- Use appropriate data types for columns (INTEGER, TEXT, REAL, BLOB, NULL)
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
- Enable foreign key support with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
- Use transactions for multiple operations
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to analyze query performance
- Consider using WAL journal mode for better concurrency
- Use VACUUM periodically to optimize database size
