# React Development Best Practices

## Components
- Prefer Functional Components with Hooks over Class Components.
- Use PascalCase for component names (`MyComponent`).
- Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Use explicit `import React from 'react';` at the top (though not strictly needed with newer JSX transforms, it's good practice for clarity).
- Define `propTypes` (if using JavaScript) or TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Use destructuring for props: `function MyComponent({ name, count }) { ... }`

## State Management
- Use `useState` for simple component-local state.
- Use `useReducer` for more complex state logic or when state transitions depend on previous state.
- Lift state up to the nearest common ancestor when multiple components need access to the same state.
- For global or shared state, consider Context API (`useContext`) for moderate complexity or dedicated state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Jotai) for larger applications.

## Hooks
- Only call Hooks at the top level of functional components or other custom Hooks.
- Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Follow the Rules of Hooks. Use ESLint plugins (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`) to enforce them.
- Use `useEffect` for side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations). Include a dependency array to control when the effect runs.
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values respectively, optimizing performance where necessary (often related to `React.memo` or heavy computations).

## Keys
- Provide stable and unique `key` props when rendering lists of elements (`<li key={item.id}>`). Avoid using array indices as keys if the list order can change or items can be inserted/deleted.

## File Structure
- Organize files by feature or route (e.g., `/features/Auth`, `/components/common`).
- Colocate components, styles, tests, and hooks related to a specific feature.

## Styling
- Choose a consistent styling approach: CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion, Tailwind CSS, plain CSS/SASS.
- Avoid inline styles for anything beyond simple dynamic adjustments.

## Performance
- Use `React.memo` to memoize components and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Analyze performance with React DevTools Profiler.
- Consider code splitting (e.g., `React.lazy` and `Suspense`) to reduce initial bundle size.

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`).
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes are used when necessary.
- Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
