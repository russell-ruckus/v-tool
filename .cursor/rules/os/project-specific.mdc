# Environment Configuration Rules

## Hidden .env File
- There is a `.env` file in the project root directory that is hidden from the agent's view
- This file contains sensitive environment variables and configuration settings
- The agent should NOT attempt to read, modify, or reference this file directly
- Instead, use the `env.template` file in the root directory as a reference for environment variable structure

## Environment Variable Guidelines

### When Working with Environment Variables:
1. **Reference the template**: Always check `env.template` to understand the expected environment variable structure
2. **Use template as guide**: The template shows the format and types of variables needed
3. **Documentation**: Update `env.template` if new environment variables are added to the project
4. **Security**: Never hardcode sensitive values or expose environment variables in code
5. **Instructions**: When environment variables are needed, provide clear instructions to the user about:
   - Which variables need to be set
   - Where to set them (in the hidden .env file)
   - How to copy from the template


### Important Notes:
- The agent cannot see the actual `.env` file contents
- Provide clear user instructions when environment configuration is needed
- Respect the hidden nature of the .env file for security purposes

## Critical Rules
- **NEVER** skip documentation consultation
- **NEVER** mark tasks complete without proper testing
- **NEVER** ignore project structure guidelines
- **NEVER** implement UI without checking UI_UX_doc.md
- **NEVER** fix errors without checking Bug_tracking.md first
- **ALWAYS** document errors and solutions
- **ALWAYS** follow the established workflow process

Remember: Build a cohesive, well-documented, and maintainable project. Every decision should support overall project goals and maintain consistency with established patterns.
