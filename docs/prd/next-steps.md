# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Using this PRD, propose a high‑level layout and interaction model for the canvas, viewport overlay, and control panels. Highlight accessibility (WCAG AA), key flows (object selection, distribution tweaks, export), and suggestions to minimize cognitive load during exploration.

## Architect Prompt
Using this PRD, outline the client‑only architecture for a pure‑SVG renderer: module boundaries (engine, samplers, transforms, renderer, presets, export), state management approach, seeded RNG, and an MVP build pipeline. Call out performance strategies and upload sanitization.
