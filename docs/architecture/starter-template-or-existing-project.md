# Starter Template or Existing Project

N/A â€” Greenfield project.

Notes:
- PRD targets a pure-SVG, client-only MVP with static hosting (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages).
- Suitable starters if desired (choose one):
  - Vite + Svelte (lightweight, great DX, strong SVG ergonomics)
  - Vite + React + TypeScript (ubiquitous ecosystem, easy hiring)
  - Next.js (App Router) deployed as static export (if planning future server features)
- Decision pending user preference; this doc will adapt accordingly.
